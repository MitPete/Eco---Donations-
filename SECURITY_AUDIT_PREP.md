### 📊 Gas Optimization

#### Gas Analysis

```javascript
// Current gas usage per function (approximate)
const gasUsage = {
  MultiSigWallet: {
    deployment: "2,100,000 gas",
    submitTransaction: "85,000 gas",
    confirmTransaction: "65,000 gas",
    executeTransaction: "variable (depends on call)",
  },

  EcoCoin: {
    deployment: "2,800,000 gas",
    transfer: "65,000 gas",
    mint: "75,000 gas",
    burn: "55,000 gas",
  },

  DonationContract: {
    deployment: "3,200,000 gas",
    donate: "180,000 gas",
    withdrawFunds: "85,000 gas",
    addFoundation: "65,000 gas",
  },

  EcoGovernance: {
    deployment: "4,100,000 gas",
    createProposal: "220,000 gas",
    vote: "95,000 gas",
    executeProposal: "variable",
  },

  AutoDonationService: {
    deployment: "2,900,000 gas",
    subscribe: "120,000 gas",
    processDonation: "200,000 gas",
    unsubscribe: "45,000 gas",
  },
};
```

#### Optimization Opportunities

- **Storage Packing**: Struct variables optimally packed
- **Function Modifiers**: Efficient access control patterns
- **Event Logging**: Optimal use of indexed parameters
- **External Calls**: Minimized external contract interactions

### 🔐 Security Model

#### Trust Assumptions

```
Trust Model:
┌─────────────────┬──────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Component       │ Trust Level      │ Mitigation      │
├─────────────────┼──────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ MultiSig Owners │ Trusted (3 of 5) │ Known parties   │
│ Foundations     │ Verified         │ KYC process     │
│ Users           │ Untrusted        │ Rate limits     │
│ External Calls  │ Untrusted        │ Fail-safe mode │
│ Oracle Data     │ N/A (future)     │ Multiple sources│
└─────────────────┴──────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

#### Threat Model

1. **Malicious User**: Rate limiting, input validation
2. **Compromised Key**: Multi-signature requirements
3. **Smart Contract Bug**: Emergency pause, upgrades
4. **Economic Attack**: Incentive alignment, limits
5. **Governance Attack**: Proposal delays, vetoes
