# 🏭 Production Environment Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide prepares the Eco Donations Platform for mainnet deployment and production operation.

## 🎯 Production Readiness Checklist

### 🔐 Security Hardening (Priority 1)

#### Multi-Signature Wallet Configuration

- **Owners**: Need 5-7 trusted addresses (team members, advisors)
- **Required Confirmations**: 3 of 5 minimum for security
- **Owner Types**:
  - Technical lead (deployment and emergency response)
  - Product lead (governance decisions)
  - Security advisor (audit oversight)
  - Legal counsel (compliance decisions)
  - Foundation representative (impact validation)

#### Smart Contract Security

- **Audit Requirements**:
  - Professional audit by recognized firm (Consensys Diligence, Trail of Bits)
  - Bug bounty program with meaningful rewards
  - Formal verification for critical functions
  - Multi-phase deployment with increasing limits

#### Access Control

- **Admin Functions**: All controlled by multi-sig
- **Emergency Controls**: Tested pause/unpause mechanisms
- **Upgrade Patterns**: Consider proxy patterns for future updates
- **Key Management**: Hardware wallets for all critical keys

### 🌐 Mainnet Deployment Strategy

#### Network Selection

- **Primary**: Ethereum Mainnet (maximum security and adoption)
- **Secondary**: Consider L2 for lower fees (Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon)
- **Benefits Analysis**:
  - Mainnet: Security, trust, ecosystem
  - L2: Lower costs, faster transactions

#### Deployment Phases

```
Phase 1: Limited Beta (24-48 hours)
- Deploy with low limits ($10K total, $100 individual)
- Invite 50 most active beta users
- Monitor all transactions closely

Phase 2: Expanded Beta (1 week)
- Increase limits ($100K total, $1K individual)
- Open to broader community
- Foundation partnerships begin

Phase 3: Full Launch (Ongoing)
- Remove artificial limits
- Full marketing campaign
- Scale monitoring and support
```

### 🏛️ Foundation Partnership Program

#### Verification Requirements

- **Legal Status**: Registered 501(c)(3) or equivalent
- **Documentation**:
  - Tax-exempt status proof
  - Financial statements (last 2 years)
  - Impact reporting examples
  - Leadership team information
- **Due Diligence**:
  - GuideStar/Charity Navigator ratings
  - Reference checks
  - Mission alignment assessment

#### Partner Onboarding

- **Application Process**: Structured form with required documents
- **Review Timeline**: 14-day standard review
- **Approval Requirements**: Multi-sig vote by governance
- **Support Level**: Dedicated onboarding assistance

### 📊 Monitoring & Alerting

#### Technical Monitoring

- **General Liability**: Platform operation coverage
- **Professional Liability**: Team and advisor coverage
- **Cyber Security**: Data breach and security incident coverage

### 🎯 Launch Preparation

#### Pre-Launch Testing

- **Security Audit**: Complete professional audit
