> I'll enter 0.01 ETH - that's about $20-30 in value, but remember, this is just test currency. I can add a personal message here, something like 'Testing for a better tomorrow!' 

> When I click 'Donate Now', MetaMask opens showing the transaction details. I can see the amount going to the foundation and the gas fee for the network. Everything looks good, so I'll confirm.

> Now we wait for blockchain confirmation - usually 30-60 seconds on Sepolia. Great! The transaction is confirmed. Let's see what happened..."

> In the History section, here's my donation record with all the details, and look at this - my unique Impact NFT! This is permanent proof of my environmental contribution, stored forever on the blockchain.

> This transparency is what makes blockchain giving so powerful - every donation is verifiable and permanent."
