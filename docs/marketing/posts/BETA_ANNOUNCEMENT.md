Title: [BETA] ECO Donations - First Decentralized Environmental Giving Platform (Looking for Testers!)

Hey r/CryptoCurrency! 👋

**TL;DR**: Built a DeFi platform for environmental donations. Beta launches August 15th. Need crypto-savvy testers who care about the environment.

**What is ECO Donations?**

A decentralized platform where crypto holders can directly fund environmental projects with full transparency and community governance.

**Key Features:**
🌍 Direct donations to verified environmental projects
🗳️ Token holders vote on funding allocations  
📊 Real-time on-chain tracking of all donations
⚡ Zero platform fees (smart contract handles everything)
🔐 Multi-sig security with Grade A audit score

**Why This Matters for Crypto:**

We often get criticized for environmental impact. This is our chance to flip the narrative and show crypto can be a force for environmental good.

**Tech Stack** (for the technically inclined):
- Hardhat smart contracts with comprehensive testing
- React frontend with Web3 integration
- MetaMask + WalletConnect support
- Sepolia testnet for beta (mainnet after testing)
- On-chain governance with proposal system

**Beta Testing Program:**

Looking for 50 testers with:
✅ DeFi/crypto experience (comfortable with wallets, testnets)
✅ Interest in environmental causes
✅ 2-5 hours/week for testing
✅ Ability to provide detailed feedback

**What's In It for Testers:**
- Early access before public launch
- Direct influence on features and design
- Beta tester badge/recognition  
- Priority access to mainnet launch
- Potential future rewards for valuable feedback

**How to Apply:**
Beta application: [Google Form Link]
Discord community: [Discord Link]
Questions: Drop them below or DM me!

**Proof of Work:**
Check our GitHub: [Link to repo]
Smart contract verification: [Etherscan link]
Security audit results: [Link to security report]

**Launch Timeline:**
- Beta applications open: Now
- Beta testing starts: August 15th
- Mainnet launch: September 2025

Been working on this for months and genuinely excited to see crypto being used for environmental good. Would love to have some of you sharp-eyed r/CryptoCurrency folks help make this bulletproof before mainnet! 

Questions, roasts, feedback - all welcome! 🚀

**Edit**: Wow, thanks for the engagement everyone! DMing everyone who expressed interest with beta application links.

**Edit 2**: For those asking about tokenomics - no native token planned initially. Focus is on facilitating donations in existing cryptos (ETH, stablecoins) to established environmental projects. Governance initially through ETH holdings, may evolve based on community feedback.
