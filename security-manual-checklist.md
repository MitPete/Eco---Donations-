# üîí Manual Smart Contract Security Checklist

## üìã Pre-Deployment Security Review

### **üéØ Critical Security Areas**

#### **1. Access Controls & Permissions**
- [ ] **Owner/Admin Controls**
  - [ ] Are admin functions properly protected?
  - [ ] Is there a multi-sig or timelock for critical functions?
  - [ ] Can ownership be transferred safely?
  - [ ] Are there emergency stop mechanisms?

- [ ] **Function Visibility**
  - [ ] Are all functions properly scoped (public/external/internal/private)?
  - [ ] No unintended public functions?
  - [ ] External calls properly validated?

#### **2. Input Validation & Bounds**
- [ ] **Parameter Validation**
  - [ ] All user inputs validated?
  - [ ] Proper bounds checking (min/max values)?
  - [ ] Address validation (non-zero checks)?
  - [ ] Array bounds protection?

- [ ] **Integer Overflow/Underflow**
  - [ ] Using SafeMath or Solidity 0.8+ built-in checks?
  - [ ] No unchecked arithmetic operations?
  - [ ] Proper handling of edge cases?

#### **3. Reentrancy Protection**
- [ ] **External Calls**
  - [ ] Follow checks-effects-interactions pattern?
  - [ ] Reentrancy guards where needed?
  - [ ] State updates before external calls?
  - [ ] No recursive call vulnerabilities?

#### **4. Token Economics & Logic**
- [ ] **ERC20 Token (EcoCoin)**
  - [ ] Proper mint/burn controls?
  - [ ] Total supply limits enforced?
  - [ ] Transfer restrictions if any?
  - [ ] Allowance mechanism secure?

- [ ] **Donation Logic**
  - [ ] Funds routing correct?
  - [ ] No fund lockup scenarios?
  - [ ] Proper event emissions?
  - [ ] Withdrawal mechanisms secure?

#### **5. Governance Security**
- [ ] **Voting Mechanism**
  - [ ] Double voting prevention?
  - [ ] Proper vote counting?
  - [ ] Quorum requirements?
  - [ ] Proposal validation?

#### **6. Gas Optimization & DoS**
- [ ] **Gas Limits**
  - [ ] No unbounded loops?
  - [ ] Reasonable gas consumption?
  - [ ] DoS via gas limit attacks prevented?

#### **7. External Dependencies**
- [ ] **Oracle/Price Feeds**
