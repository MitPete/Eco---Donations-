3. **Initial Containment**
   - If security incident: Enable emergency pause
   - If performance issue: Scale resources
   - If contract issue: Verify multi-sig status

### Step 2: Investigation and Diagnosis (15-60 minutes)

1. **Data Collection**

   - System logs and metrics
   - Blockchain transaction history
   - User impact reports
   - Error traces and stack dumps

2. **Root Cause Analysis**

   - Timeline reconstruction
   - Component failure analysis
   - External factor assessment
   - Security vulnerability review

3. **Impact Assessment**
   - User count affected
   - Financial impact
   - Data integrity check
   - Regulatory implications

### Step 3: Resolution and Recovery (Varies by severity)

1. **Develop Fix Strategy**

   - Immediate workaround
   - Permanent solution plan
   - Risk assessment
   - Rollback procedures

2. **Implementation**

   - Code fixes and testing
   - Infrastructure changes
   - Contract upgrades (if applicable)
   - Configuration updates

3. **Verification**
   - System functionality tests
   - Performance validation
   - Security verification
   - User acceptance testing

### Step 4: Communication (Ongoing)

1. **Internal Communication**

   - Regular status updates in incident channel
   - Stakeholder briefings
   - Technical documentation
   - Timeline updates

2. **External Communication**
   - Status page updates
   - User notifications
   - Community updates
   - Regulatory reporting (if required)

## 5. Smart Contract Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Pause Protocol

```solidity
// Multi-signature requirement for emergency actions
function emergencyPause() external onlyMultiSig {
    _pause();
    emit EmergencyPause(msg.sender, block.timestamp);
}
```

### Emergency Actions

1. **Pause Contracts**: Stop all operations
2. **Freeze Funds**: Prevent withdrawals
3. **Upgrade Path**: Deploy fixed contracts
4. **Recovery Process**: Restore normal operations

### Multi-Sig Emergency Process

1. **Immediate Response**: Any 2 of 5 can pause
2. **Investigation**: Full 3 of 5 required for changes
3. **Recovery**: 4 of 5 required for major changes
4. **Post-Incident**: All 5 required for policy changes
