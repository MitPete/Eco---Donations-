# Frontend Tests

This directory is reserved for frontend-specific tests.

## Structure

- `unit/` - Unit tests for individual components
- `integration/` - Integration tests for component interactions
- `e2e/` - End-to-end browser tests
- `fixtures/` - Test data and mock files

## Usage

```bash
npm test
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:coverage
```

Tests should be created as the frontend components are developed.
