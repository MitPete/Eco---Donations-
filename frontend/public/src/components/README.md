# Frontend Components

This directory contains React/Vue/vanilla JS components for the frontend.

## Structure

- `common/` - Shared components across pages
- `donation/` - Donation-related components
- `governance/` - Governance interface components
- `analytics/` - Dashboard and analytics components
- `wallet/` - Wallet connection and management components

## Guidelines

- Each component should have its own directory
- Include component, styles, and test files together
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Document component props and usage

Components will be organized here as the frontend modularization progresses.
